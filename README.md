## Introduction
This is a repository where I keep track of what I learnt of using React.js and how they can be applied to future projects

## Motivation
Recently, I was approached by a friend of mine, to help him out developing a platform which involved using React.js and other core JavaScript functionalities. Having background knowledge on JavaScript and wanting to know more how this awesome library works, I've decided to dedicate my free time onto this. This repository will be an exploration/experimentation repo and in future I aim to create an testing web service for my own.
